stt pipeline expects continuous stream, if audio writer stalls it may stop recognizing 

voice chat watchdog relies on incoming PCM packets to identify a disconnect and initiate a restart

latency, leaks, and race conditions possible due to relying on FFmpegPCMAudio

long term disk memory is unprotected from corruption, could fail to boot and lose it all

azureSTT expects constant audio but discordrecv does not send silence. artificial audio injected into voice stream could cause improper endpointing

currently feeding PCM packets directly into asyncio loop, could eventually cause back pressure. need a queue system "from queue import SimpleQueue" for chunking, and a back pressure monitor for occasionally disposing of oldest frames
